## ðŸ§¯Project Manager for UI Team

As the leader of the team, I set expectations for the team and for myself to create consistent UI designs that followed the theme of the video game.

Below is from left to right are the drafts that led to the final product on the far right. Our theme for the game was inspired by the Indiana Jones movies. There was about 2 revisions to the logo and background screen for the title sequence.

The logo was created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
