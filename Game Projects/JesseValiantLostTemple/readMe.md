# How it started and give context!

2.5D Metroid Vania

Jessie Valiant, an intrepid explorer, becomes trapped in a previously unknown temple belonging to an ancient advanced civilization

Jessie must acquire artifacts that grant her abilities that will allow her to overcome the various puzzles, traps, and guardian statues that fill the temple

In the process of escaping the temple, Jessie will learn the true nature of the creators of the temple; a truth that will change the world as we know it

I was Project Manager for the UI team for this class project, and worked on the programming for the UI.

## üßØProject Manager for UI Team

As the leader of the team, I set expectations for the team and for myself to create consistent UI designs that followed the theme of the video game.

Below is from left to right are the drafts that led to the final product on the far right. Our theme for the game was inspired by the Indiana Jones movies. There was about 2 revisions to the logo and background screen for the title sequence.

The logo was created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

## ‚è∏Ô∏èPause Menu

The design was created by my team and the UI interaction was done in Unity by me.

We were inspired by the Disney movie Atlantis: The Lost Empire for the design and colors for the menu

Throughout the gameplay of the game the player will interact with ancient technology that had engravings on the side of the walls that looked like the pause menu plate. The player found this slate before exploring temple and is trying to find out the mysteries of the temple with this artifact that parents' colleagues found years ago.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πHealth UI

As a team we agreed upon having the characters face in the radial health.

We wanted to do a different health bar in the game rather than the simple green to red bar. Making it radial gave us more space to be creative and use the characters expressions to show that they were hurt. The health went down in sections, for example, full health Jessie would be at 6 and when she was low she would have 2 bars left.

I programmed the animation of the players health going up & down and connected it to the gameplay programmers code so the UI would correspond with the player.

## What did I learn from this project?
*Explain what you had learned, experienced, or simply how you felt during the project.*

This project was for a fall semester of my Junior year and it was a big class putting together all of our skills to create a video game together. So my biggest fear was not getting this done fully in a short period of time, and it came true.

We were the first class that had ever to try this theory out. Unfortunately the game was not completed, but my team & I did the most we could in the time we had to get more than 50% of the desired assets done.

*How I overcame these fears & struggles.*

As a team our biggest struggle was time management, with other classes it was a struggle to get assets done in time, but I kept good communication with the team and would offer to assist them in their work to take some of the load off of their shoulders.

Another way I overcame the time management, we followed the SCRUM we set up together to meet deadlines, created a group chat to hold calls and discuss design directions and set aside some time throughout the week to give 100% focus to the project together.
